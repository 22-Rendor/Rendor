        <h2>About Me</h2>
<!--
        <p><br>Computer Information Systems graduate, currently working full-time as a System Administrator. 
          Over the past 4 years, I’ve built experience across multiple IT roles, including networking, server management, endpoint security, and general system operations. 
          Working in real-world production environments every day has pushed me to dive deeper into cybersecurity — not just how systems work, but how they can break, and how to defend them effectively.
        
        
        <br><br>Rendor is my passion project designed to share my journey, research, and practical insights into
        cybersecurity and computer science. While I focus a lot on Hack The Box labs, I also cover a broad range of
        topics, from vulnerabilities and exploits to system design and ethical hacking. I’m creating this resource
        because I wish something like this had been available when I was starting out — a place with clear
          explanations, hands-on examples, and a willingness to share what I’ve learned.
          Whether you're just starting or looking to refine your skills, I  hope this resource can provide the guidance and knowledge you need.
